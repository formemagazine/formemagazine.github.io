<h2>Giorgio Armani, the man who softened fashion</h2>

<p><strong>Before Giorgio Armani, power dressing was loud.</strong></p>

<p>The 1970s and early ’80s were defined by heavy structures, sharp tailoring, aggressive shoulders, and commanding colors. Fashion functioned as armor — strength was built directly into the garment.</p>

<p>Then Armani shifted the narrative.</p>

<p>He removed internal structures. Reduced padding. Softened silhouettes. In doing so, he redefined power — not as force, but as control.</p>

<p>His wool blazers appeared structured yet fluid. Matte finishes replaced shine. Neutrals replaced excess. Authority no longer needed volume to be visible.</p>

<p>Then came silk.</p>

<p>Traditional tailoring emphasized rigidity. Armani introduced movement. His silk blazers draped instead of constrained, creating motion rather than angles.</p>

<p>Compared to designers embracing spectacle and drama, Armani chose restraint. Where others sculpted exaggeration, he sculpted precision.</p>

<p><strong>Before Armani, tailoring imposed structure.</strong></p>

<p><strong>After Armani, tailoring followed the body.</strong></p>
